## 5 tips to transform your eating habits
### 6 types of hunger
1. *Thirst*: Our ancestors couldn't transport water that easily, most hydration came from food. So, when thirsty, body sends signal of hunger.
2. *Variety*: After eating same food for season, body is filled with nutrition and toxins from the type of food. So it asks for variety of food.
3. *Empty Stomach*: Whenever stomach is empty, we associate it with hunger. When stomach stays empty, stomach can repair itself. Try to drink water if empty stomach feeling becomes strong.
4. *Low Blood Sugar*: When body is used to burning sugar, it feels hunger when it becomes low in sugar. Let the feeling stay to allow body to burn fat. Eat good quality carbs, and sometimes even avoid carbs. Low blood sugar makes one feel depressed and its most common cause on giving up on diets.
5. *Emotional Hunger*: Wanting to eat when having bad feeling. Try to create real connections when feeling emotional hunger instead of eating.
6. *Nutritional Hunger*: The actual hunger when body needs nutrition. Body can't specify the exact thing it needs, so we often eat nutritionally empty food, which still doesn't satisfy body's need for nutrition.

### Get Enough of Good

### Food timeline
Whenever making emotional decision, follow the steps:
1. Identify emotional state
2. Observe inner debate.

### Decoding Food Industry
- They want you to eat more than you need.
- Studies are paid and use some common sense before believing. Egs of misleading slogans:
  - Low fat doesn't mean healthy
  - Low sugar doesn't mean healthy
  - Natural doesn't means healthy. Natural means it has artificial flavouring with just enough natural content to call it natural.
- Industry tries to impose their food with events. Eg
  - Cake with birthday
  - Candies with christmas
#### Problems with sugar
1. Sugar causes insulin surge, which creates nutrition depletion, which further makes body want more food.
2. Sugar is addictive.
